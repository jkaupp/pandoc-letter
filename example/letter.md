I am writing to convey my interest in the Assessment and Quality Assurance position, number 00502164.  For the past 3 years, I have been working in a variety of roles and I am responsible for many projects at Queen's, as well as national and international collaborative initiatives and research.  Nearly all of these roles are highly related, and focus on aspects of educational research,assessment and the improvement of teaching and learning in higher education. Due to my experience, I believe that I would be a strong candidate for this position as my previous experience aligns remarkably well with the responsibilities and skills outlined in the position. 

Through my work with the EGAD Project, I have built experience in developing processes, training and support for Canadian engineering institutions to address the outcomes-based, continuous program improvement accreditation mandate set forth by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB).  I would consult with members of the Canadian engineering community, offering recommendations and advice drawn from effective practise in learning outcomes assessment and data-informed continuous improvement.  These conversations routinely focused on change management challenges, such as working with faculty to promote change, developing sustainable assessment approaches, and changing educational technologies to streamline program improvement. 

I work with Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science to help refine their approach to meeting CEAB accreditation.  I work with departments, supporting curriculum mapping and the collection, analysis and visualization of their assessment data.  I provide assistance in developing assessment tools and instruments to assessing graduate attributes, employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches to triangulate measurement. Coincident with some of my work with the EGAD Project, I have been working with Desire2Learn's Brightspace and Insights tools as part of the Queen's approach with the overall goal of having a single integrated platform to unify and streamline the assessment, collection and reporting on graduate attribute indicators and other learning outcomes.  

As a research associate, I have been responsible for conducting and managing classroom, program and institutional research projects in higher education including engineering education, assessment and culture change.  Many of the projects routinely required collaboration with researchers from disciplines and departments outside of engineering, including Institutional and Research Planning and the Centre for Teaching Learning. Each project required independent and effective management to meet deadlines and requirements set forth by funding agencies and the ability to make informed decisions regarding the direction of the research.  I also assumed the responsibility for authoring academic publications, conference proceedings and reports as well as present the results of research to administration, colleagues and other stakeholders.  

\newpage
Teaching has provided me with a practical, hands-on knowledge of assessment, teaching strategies, developing curriculum and continuous improvement.  I have had the opportunity to teach a fourth year technical elective in mechanical engineering in both 2012 and 2014, which provided me with an avenue to practically implement my research.  In the first offering of the course, I relied primarily on traditional methods of teaching in engineering and focused on including authentic assessment in the course.  When I was offered the opportunity to teach the course again, I immediately consulted my reflections, teaching evaluations and assessments to make informed improvements. Consistent with research findings in teaching and learning, I adopted an student-centred, active learning approach and developed learning activities around student exploration of concepts through guided inquiry and continued with improvements to assessments from the previous offering.  Overall this experience provided me with a wealth of knowledge and experience to help with my other roles in working with faculty embrace learning outcomes, adopt evidence-based teaching, employ authentic means of assessment and use the results to inform teaching and improve curriculum.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to discussing this exciting opportunity with you.
