I am writing to convey my interest in the Assessment and Quality Assurance Coordinator position, competition number 2015-052. For the past 3 years, I have been working in a variety of roles where I am responsible for many projects at Queen's, as well as national and international collaborative initiatives and research. Nearly all of these roles are directly related to, and focus on aspects of educational research, assessment and the improvement of teaching and learning in higher education. The skills and responsibilities I have developed through my previous experience and in my current role align directly with this position, making me a strong candidate.

Through my work with the Engineering Graduate Attribute Development (EGAD) Project, I have experience in developing processes, training and support for Canadian engineering institutions to address the outcomes-based, continuous program improvement accreditation mandate set forth by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). I consult with members of the Canadian engineering community regularly, offering recommendations and advice drawn from effective practise in learning outcomes assessment and data-informed continuous improvement. These conversations routinely focused on change management challenges, such as working with faculty to promote change, developing sustainable assessment approaches, and changing educational technologies to streamline program improvement.

Presently, I work in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science helping to refine their approach to meeting CEAB accreditation.  I work directly with various departments, supporting curriculum mapping and the collection, analysis and visualization of their assessment data.  I provide assistance developing assessment tools and instruments to assess graduate attributes, employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches to triangulate measurement. Coincident with some of my work with the EGAD Project, I have been working with Desire2Learn's Brightspace and Insights tools as part of a team leading the integration of these tools into course-based assessment of learning outcomes.  I also consult with Desire2Learn in a development capacity, advising their re-design efforts from an effective-practise perspective of assessment and visualization of learning outcomes data, with the goal of providing useful and meaningful information to diverse stakeholders.
\newpage
As a research associate, I have been responsible for conducting and managing classroom, program and institutional research projects in higher education including engineering education, assessment and culture change. Many of the projects routinely required collaboration with researchers from disciplines and departments outside of engineering, including Institutional and Research Planning and the Centre for Teaching Learning. Each project has required my independent and effective management to meet deadlines and requirements set forth by funding agencies and the ability to make informed decisions regarding the direction of the research. I have also assumed the responsibility for authoring academic publications, conference proceedings and reports, presenting the results of research to administration, colleagues and other stakeholders.  

Teaching has provided me with a practical, hands-on knowledge of assessment, teaching strategies, developing curriculum and continuous improvement. I have had the opportunity to teach a fourth year technical elective in mechanical engineering in both 2012 and 2014, which provided me with an avenue to practically implement my research. In the first offering of the course, I relied primarily on traditional methods of teaching in engineering and focused on including authentic assessment in the course. When I was offered the opportunity to teach the course again, I immediately consulted my reflections, teaching evaluations and assessments to make informed improvements. Consistent with research findings in teaching and learning, I adopted a student-centred, active learning approach and developed learning activities around student exploration of concepts through guided inquiry and continued with making improvements to assessments from the previous offering. Overall this experience provided me with a wealth of knowledge and experience to help with my other roles in working with faculty to embrace learning outcomes, adopt evidence-based teaching, employ authentic means of assessment and use the results to inform teaching and improve curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing this exciting opportunity with you.
