I am writing to convey my interest in the Assessment and Quality Assurance position, number 00502164.  For the past 3 years, I have been working in a variety of roles and have been responsible for many projects at Queen's as well as national and international collaborative initatives and research. I believe that I would be a strong candidate for this position as my previous experience aligns remarkably well with the responsibilities and skills outlined in the position. 

Through my work with the EGAD Project, I have built experience in developing processes, training and support for Canadian engineering institutions to address the outcomes-based, continuous program improvement accreditation mandate set forth by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB).  I would consult with members of the Canadian engineering community, offering recommendations and advice drawn from effective practise in learning outcomes assessment and data-informed continuous improvement.  These conversations routinely focused on change management challenges, such as working with faculty to promote change, developing sustainable assessment approaches, and changing educational technologies to streamline program improvement. 

I work with Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science to help refine their approach to meeting CEAB accreditation.  I work with deparments, supporting curriculum mapping and the collection, analysis and visualization of their assessment data.  The majority of this work is facilitated by Excel for data collection, relational databases (MySQL) for data storage, and using R for the analysis and visualization of the data.  Recently, I have been working with Desire2Learn's Brightspace and Insights tools as part of the Queen's approach with the overall goal of having a single integrated platform to unify and streamline the assessment, collection and reporting on graduate attritbue indicators and other learning outcomes. 

As a research associate in engineering education, I have been responsible for developing, conducting and managing classroom, program and instititional research projects involving the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.  The majority of these projects required a mixed methods approach and focused on assessment, learning outcomes, or the improvement of engineering education.  They routinely required collaboration with researchers from disciplines and departments outside of engineering, including Institutional and Research Planning and the Centre for Teaching Learning.  These projects required effective management to meet deadlines and requirements set forth by funding agencies and were independently managed, while keeping principal investigators apprised of developments.
