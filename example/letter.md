I am writing to convey my interest in the Assessment and Quality Assurance position, position number 00502164.  For the past 3 years, I have been working with Dr. Brian Frank as a research associate in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Queen's University. Through this position I have been responsible for numerous projects within Queen's, across Canada and internationally.

I believe that I would be a strong candidate for this position, as my work during the past 3 years aligns remarkably well with the responsibilities and skills outlined in the position.  Through my work with the EGAD Project, I have built experience in developing processes, training and support for Canadian engineering institutions to address the outcomes-based, continuous program improvement accreditation mandate set forth by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB).  I would routinely consult with the Canadian engineering community, offering recommendations and advice drawn from effective practise in learning outcomes assessment and data-informed continuous improvement.  These conversations routinely focused on change management challenges, such as working with faculty to promote change, developing sustainable assessment approaches, and changing educational technologies to streamline program improvement.  Recently my EGAD Project work has focused on the visualization of assessment data, and the use of learning analytics to provide rapid, actionable and reliable information for course and program improvement.  These are areas of great interest to me, as I see a great need being serviced by these applications as engineering programs mature in their assessment efforts.  To increase awareness of these issues, I have been reviewing a vast array of educational and learning technologies and evaluating them on how well they can support the CEAB accreditation mandate and how well they align with the EGAD effective-practise approach.

I also work for Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, to help further develop and refine their approach to meeting CEAB accreditation.  I have been working with deparments supporting curriculum mapping and the collection, analysis and visualization of their assessment data. The majority of this work is facilitated by Excel for data collection, MySQL for data storage, and using R for the analysis and visualization of the data.  I have been working with the faculty and various specialists in using Desire2Learn's Brightspace as an integrated platform for the assessment, data collection and reporting of graduate attritbue indicators and other learning outcomes.  I have also been a with Desire2Learn, representing both Queen's and the EGAD Project, to refine their insights tool as member of their analytics advisory board.  Recently I have helping various departments map their programs and conduct assessment for both internal and external quality assurance matters (QUCAP and CEAB).
